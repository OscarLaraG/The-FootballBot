# The-FootballBot (BETA)
A discordBot for Football Fanatics

**Project Title:** The FootballBot (BETA)
This Project will be based around Web-Scraping LIVE data from official Football league sites such as: The Premier League, La Liga etc. The bot will be able to return highest scorers, top assisters, top dribblers, etc.

**Techniques:**
To get specific data, the project will be using BeautifulSoup, JSON packages, Postman to download cURL's, Selenium, and python.

**Resources:**
