# The-FootballBot (BETA)
A discordBot for Football Fanatics

**Project Title:** The FootballBot (BETA)
This Project will be based around Web-Scraping LIVE data from official Football league sites such as: The Premier League, La Liga etc. The bot will be able to return highest scorers, top assisters, top dribblers, etc.

**Keep in mind: Some files are not available to the public. This is to protect my token, and functionality.**

**Techniques:**
To get specific data, the project will be using BeautifulSoup, JSON packages, Postman to download cURL's, Selenium, and python.

**Resources:**

https://www.premierleague.com/stats/top/players/goals?se=489

**Current Progress/Commands**
1) Succesfully coded the Bot to appear ONLINE, and be able to begin to give responses based off commands to be added

2) Added ?TopScorer command: This commannd currently (at the time of writing) returns Erling Haaland, as he is the current top scorer of the English Premier League

3) Added ?TopAssister command: At the time, will return Kevin De Bruyne. 16 assists.

**To-Do**
- Add commands for other stats.
- Create a small chat script to have user and bot interact with small talk.
